# RISC-V Codegen

An app to generate some simple RISC-V code.

## Features

There's really only one thing I wanted to make this for; I might add some more later if I want to lol.

### Function Definition Scaffolding

Helps you quickly define a function, complete with optional pushing/popping to stack, block comments and register usage.

## Local Installation


```bash 
npm i 
npm run dev     # start dev server
npm run build   # build for production
```
